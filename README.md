# HC-CNN for Microplastic Classification
An implementation of the Holographic-Classifier Convolutional Neural Network (HC-CNN) for automatic classification of microplastic pollutants from raw holographic images. This project provides a fast, lightweight, and efficient tool for environmental monitoring, eliminating the need for complex image pre-processing.

This repository provides a complete pipeline to train the HC-CNN model, evaluate its performance, and run inference on new holograms.

âœ¨ Features
- Lightweight Model: An efficient CNN architecture perfect for real-time analysis.

- End-to-End Pipeline: Scripts for data preparation, training, and evaluation.

- Direct Inference: Classify pollution levels directly from raw hologram files.

- High Performance: Aims to replicate the high accuracy (~97%) and efficiency reported in the original paper.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project and run the model on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip & a virtual environment tool (venv)
2. Installation
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hc-cnn-microplastics.git](https://github.com/your-username/hc-cnn-microplastics.git)
cd hc-cnn-microplastics
```
Next, create and activate a Python virtual environment. This keeps your project dependencies isolated.
```
# For Linux/macOS
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
Finally, install all the required packages from the requirements.txt file:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
ðŸ’» Usage
This repository includes scripts for training, evaluating, and running predictions.

Training the Model
To train the HC-CNN model from scratch, run the train.py script from the root directory.
```
python src/train.py --epochs 120 --learning-rate 0.0001 --batch-size 32
```

- epochs: Number of training epochs. The optimal range is 100-130.

- learning-rate: The learning rate for the Adam optimizer.

- batch-size: Number of samples per training batch.

The script will save the best performing model weights to the models/ directory.

Evaluating the Model
Once training is complete, you can evaluate the model's performance on the test set using evaluate.py.

```
python src/evaluate.py --model-path models/hc_cnn_best.h5
```

This script will print a classification report with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. It will also save a normalized confusion matrix image to the results/ folder.

Making a Prediction
To classify a single raw hologram image, use the predict.py script.
```
python src/predict.py --model-path models/hc_cnn_best.h5 --image-path /path/to/your/hologram.png
```

ðŸ“Š Performance
This implementation aims to replicate the state-of-the-art results from the original research. The HC-CNN is both highly accurate and computationally efficient compared to deeper architectures like ResNet or VGG.
